# Release Notes

## August 2025

### New Features

- Update for OL9U6, support for UEK8
- Vagrant VirtualBox: if `VAGRANT_GUEST_ADDITIONS_KERNEL` is set to `yes`, do not install the VirtualBox Guest Additions
  if the kernel already support these (UEK kernel). Default is `no` for backwards compatibility

### Changes

- `CPU_NUM` now accepts topology information using the `virt-install` syntax: `VCPUS[,maxvcpus=MAX][,sockets=#][,cores=#][,threads=#]`
- Vagrant VirtualBox: set display controller to `VMSVGA` (`VBoxVGA` being deprecated)

### Bug fixes

- Fixed issue when `ISO_URL` is referring to a file (#196, contributed by @retekdk)
- Vagrant: correctly set target kernel in motd, refactor installation of the
  VirtualBox guest additions

## March 2025

Note: OL7 Premier Support ended on 31 December 2024, scripts will only be maintained for the OL8 and newer images.

### New Features

- aarch64 support for vagrant-virtualbox (on Apple silicon)
- UEFI support for x86_64.  
  `BOOT_MODE` can be set to `bios`, `uefi` or `hybrid`. In hybrid mode the image is compatible with both Legacy BIOS and UEFI
- new `SERIAL_CONSOLE_RUNTIME` build parameter to configure serial console in the generated image

### Changes

- The partition layout is now [GPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table) for all images
- Install the audit package (allow SELinux auditing)

### Bug fixes

- OL9: update BLS files when grub config is updated
- OLVM OL9 templates have now the correct OS id (was set to OL8 for compatibility reason)

### Refactor

- The partitioning in the _kickstart_ files is generated dynamically in the `%pre` section

## November 2024

### New Features

- Update for OL9.5

### Bug fixes

- Fix regression for Vagrant Virtualbox boxes (set default NIC type to `virtio`)

## September 2024

### Bug fixes

- Use a version-based sort on the output of osinfo-query to ensure we always use the latest available variant on the build host when creating the initial VM

## May 2024

### New Features

- OL 8.10 & OL9.4 update

### Bug fixes

- Truncate `/etc/resolv.conf` in cleanup
- Pin `kernel-uek-core` to prevent accidental removal

## March 30, 2024

### Bug fixes

- `cloud-init collect-logs` requires `tar`

## March, 2024

Major refactoring of the scripts, reducing dependencies on third parties.
The build tools mainly rely on  [`qemu-kvm`](http://www.qemu.org/), using [`libvirt`](https://libvirt.org/) and [`libguestfs`](https://libguestfs.org/).

As it is a breaking change, previous version has been archived under the `olit-legacy` branch (unmaintained).

### Refactor

The overall build process has been changed. In previous releases we had:

1. Create image from distribution ISO and a kickstart file
1. Customize the image by running provision scripts inside the running VM
1. Cleanup the environment by mounting the image filesystems on the host;
   the outcome is a raw disk image
1. Package the image for the target cloud

As of this release, we have:

1. Create image: unchanged
1. Use [`virt-customize`](customize) to run the provisioning scripts
1. Use [`virt-sysprep`](https://libguestfs.org/virt-sysprep.1.html)/[`virt-sparsify`](https://libguestfs.org/virt-sparsify.1.html) for the cleanup;
   the outcome is a compressed qcow2 image
1. Package image: unchanged

Notable code changes:

- Drop support for [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) as __builder__ (you can still create Vagrant VirtualBox __images__)
- `image-scripts.sh` `::seal()` functions obsolete; code moved to `provision.sh` `::cleanup()` functions.
  We don't need anymore a separate _offline_ cleanup as `virt-customize` doesn't actually run the built VM.
- Simplify `provision.sh` `::cleanup()` functions as most parts are now handled by `virt-sysprep` operations.
- Add `image-scripts.sh` `::customize_args()` and  `::sysprep_args()` hooks to inject command line parameters for  `virt-customize` and `virt-sysprep`.
- Root privileges are no longer required on the build host.
- Root access to the image VM is no longer needed at built time. Root password and/or ssh public key can still be set for the image; parameters have been renamed to ensure configuration is secure by default.
- Move common code to the `common.sh` and `provision-common.sh` libraries.
- QCOW2 image files now have the `qcow2` extension instead of `qcow`.

### Configuration variables

Changes to the configuration variables.
See the corresponding `env.properties` files for more details.

New variables

- Generic
  - `INSTALL_WAIT_TIME`: configurable timeout for initial image creation
  - `OS_VARIANT` (optional): OS variant used when creating the image
  - `BOOT_MODE`: OS boot mode (`bios` or `efi`)
  - `BOOT_COMMAND_SERIAL_CONSOLE`: kernel parameters to enable serial console
  - `BOOT_LOCATION`(optional): kernel and initrd location on the distribution media
  - `ROOT_PASSWORD` (optional, default: locked): password for the root account in the generated image
  - `ROOT_SSH_KEY` (optional): public ssh key the root account in the generated image
  - `PERMIT_ROOT_LOGIN` (Default: prohibit-password): default policy for ssh root login
  - `CACHE_DIR` (Default: `.cache` in workspace directory): location of ISO images cache
- utm cloud
  - `OPC_PASSWORD`: password for the `opc` user for UTM builds

Changed variables

- `DISTR`: is now mandatory
- `ISO_LABEL`: is now optional
- `BOOT_COMMAND`: array of kernel parameters instead of a string

Obsolete variables

- `LOCK_ROOT`, `SSH_KEY_FILE`, `SSH_PASSWORD`: root access to the image is not needed anymore, see new `ROOT_PASSWORD`, `ROOT_SSH_KEY` if root access to the generated image is needed
- `X2APIC`
- `PACKER`, `PACKER_BUILD_OPTIONS`, `PACKER_BUILDER`
- `QEMU_BINARY`

### New features

- sshd `PermitRootLogin` parameter is now `prohibit-password` by default for all images (instead of `yes` for OL7/OL8)
- update azure cloud for OL9

### Bug fixes

- Wrong pattern matching in bash regular expressions when validating variables
- TERM variable in serial console configuration for OVM not escaped properly
- Wrong swap page size for aarch64 builds when host is running UEK6 kernel
- Workaround for OL8 cloud-init issue in OCI
- Setup OCI yum mirrors for OCI images
